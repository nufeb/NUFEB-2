The Makefile.lammps file in this directory is used when building LAMMPS with
its USER-NUFEB package installed. 

To dump simulation results in VTK format (and visualize in paraview), 
you need to link LAMMPS with the VTK library.

To dump simulation results in HDF format, 
you need to link LAMMPS with the HDF library.

You should choose a Makefile.lammps.* file compatible with 
your system and your version of VTK or VTK, and
copy it to Makefile.lammps before building LAMMPS itself.  
You may need to edit one of the provided files to match your system.

To illustrate, these are example settings from the
Makefile.lammps.ubuntu16.04_vtk6.2 file:

nufeb_SYSINC = -std=c++1y -DENABLE_DUMP_GRID -I/usr/include/vtk-6.2 
nufeb_SYSLIB = -lvtksys-6.2 -lvtkCommonCore-6.2 -lvtkCommonExecutionModel-6.2 -lvtkCommonMisc-6.2 -lvtkCommonMath-6.2 -lvtkCommonSystem-6.2 -lvtkCommonTransforms-6.2 -lvtkIOCore-6.2 -lvtkIOXML-6.2 -lvtkIOXMLParser-6.2 -lvtkIOLegacy-6.2 -lvtkIOParallelXML-6.2 -lvtkCommonDataModel-6.2 -lvtkParallelCore-6.2
nufeb_SYSPATH =

vtk_SYSINC refers to the include directory of the installed VTK library, 
-DENABLE_DUMP_GRID is the flag to dump mesh grid information
-I/usr/include/vtk-6.2 is the path where the VTK library
can be found.

vtk_SYSLIB refers to the libraries needed to link to from an application
(LAMMPS in this case) to "embed" VTK in the application. VTK consists of
multiple shared libraries which are needed when using the USER-NUFEB package.

vtk_SYSPATH = refers to the path (e.g. -L/usr/local/lib) where the VTK library
can be found.  You may not need this setting if the path is already included in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
