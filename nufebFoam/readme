nufebFoam is CFD-DEM solver built on top of SediFOAM [1] to simulate hydrodynamic biofilm. The tool combines NUFEB (LAMMPS) and OpenFOAM.

NUFEB is an open source molecular dynamics code that perform DEM simulations.

OpenFOAM is an open source toolbox for CFD simulations.

The structure of the nufebFoam is:

nufebFoam
|
|----Allwclean.sh
|----Allwmake.sh
|----documentation/
|----CFD-DEM package (in LAMMPS)/
|----src/
|----readme/

Allwclean.sh are Allwmake.sh written to help with the compilation of nufebFoam. 
Allwmake.sh will help you install nufebFoam while Allclean.sh will uninstall
nufebFoam. Note that the source file of NUFEB is not included in nufebFoam.

src/ is folder containing the source code of nufebFoam.
