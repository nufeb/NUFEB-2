G, hence ˜Gt, typically depends on parameters that must be specified
for the usual analysis to apply. In the two above examples, the
decay parameter λ enters into G. In many applications, it will be
possible to specify values in advance; otherwise it may be desired to

widen the analysis to allow for uncertainty in some of the elements
of G and to incorporate learning about them. Some preliminary
discussion of these sorts of problems appears in the next section,
further development being left to later chapters.

θt = λθt−1 + ωt.
For known λ, the usual analysis applies. Otherwise, if it is desired to learn
about λ from the data, a much more complicated analysis is implied. With
λ constant over time, though unknown, the formal analysis proceeds as
follows:
