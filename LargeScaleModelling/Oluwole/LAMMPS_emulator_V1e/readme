############LAMMPS EMULATOR version 1e####################
(A) DESCRIPTION
This version of LAMMPS emulator produces Rates of change of the following characterized outputs from the IBM model
For instance, dH/dt=(H_2-H_1)/(T_2-T_1)
(i) Total biomass concentration (kg)
(ii) Biofilm total number of individual particle (unitless)
(ii) Biofilm average height (metre)
(iv) Biofilm surface roughness (metre).

(B) All required data and R scripts for the emulator are in the directory "LAMMPS_emulator_V1d". 
The main R source code is "emu.R". 

(C) Input file description:
A sample "input.txt" file is placed in the "input" subfolder which is a required input parameters for running the emulator.
This contain 9 different values
The input values [1..5] represent "nh3","no2","no3","o2","co2" local nutrient substrates (mol/L) respectively. 
The input values [6..9] represent current values of "Biomass concentration","total number of particle","Biofilm height","Biofilm surface roughness"

(D) RUN the code:
The main source code is "emu.cpp". The emulator can be run from either the Window or Linux platform. 
Put the input file "input.txt" to be run in the subfolder "input". These files contain the parameter values and initial conditions.
To run any case, the input parameters must be converted to the units stated above to get correct results.

To run from Linux terminal:
$ cd path to /LAMMPS_emulator_V1e
/** compile .cpp file
$ g++ -O3 -I/usr/include/eigen3/ emu.cpp -o emu
/** run the code as
$ ./emu

(E) Obtain the simulation results from subfolder "output".
It takes less than 30 seconds to run the sample script on both platforms.

NOTE: This emulator will produce output for any specified time-steps and for any parameter combinations
