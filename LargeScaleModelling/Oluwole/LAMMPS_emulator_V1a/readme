############LAMMPS EMULATOR version 1a####################
DESCRIPTION
This version of LAMMPS emulator produces floc total mass and EPS total mass at each time step (g *10^{-16}), floc equivalent diameter and number of particles at each time step. The emulator can provide its outputs as a snapshot.bubblemd file. The emulator is run from "flat_surface.in" and "Inputscript.lammps" data file. 

All required data and R scripts for the emulator are in the directories access and Input subfolders. All the outputs from running the emulator go into the subfolder "Output". The main R source code is "LAMMPS.R". There are some options to select and set in the configuration file before the emulator can be run to produce the desired results.

CONFIGURATION FILE
This emulator can run for various configuration options to change the default options. 

RUN THE CODE
The main source code is "LAMMPS.R". The emulator can be run from either the Window or Linux platform. 
 (A) Put the input files "flat_surface.in" and "Inputscript.lammps" to be run in the subfolder "Input". These files contain the parameter values and initial conditions.
 (B) Set the configuration file.
 (C) Run the emulator: Require DiceKriging package (not necessary for now)
(i) To run from Window machine:
 At R console
> setwd(/path to/LAMMPS_emulator_V1a)
> source("LAMMPS.R",echo=TRUE)

(ii) To run from Linux terminal:
$ cd path to /LAMMPS_emulator_V1a
$ R CMD BATCH LAMMPS.R result.txt 

(D) Obtain the results from subfolder "Output".

OUTPUT RESULTS
1) Number of particle at each time step
2) Floc diameter at each timestep
3) Floc total mass at each timestep

NOTE: This emulator will produce output for any specified time-steps
