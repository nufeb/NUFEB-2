############LAMMPS EMULATOR version 1b####################
(A) DESCRIPTION
This version of LAMMPS emulator produces Rates of change of the following characterized outputs from the IBM model
For instance, dH/dt=(H_2-H_1)/(T_2-T_1)
(i) Total biomass concentration (kg)
(ii) Biofilm total number of individual particle (unitless)
(ii) Biofilm average height (metre)
(iv) Biofilm surface roughness (metre).

(B) All required data and R scripts for the emulator are in the directory "LAMMPS_emulator_V1b". 
The main R source code is "emu.R". 

(C) Input file description:
A sample "input.txt" file is placed in the "input" subfolder which is a required input parameters for running the emulator.
This contain 10 different values
The input values [1..5] represents "nh3","no2","no3","o2","co2" initial boundary concentrations (mol/L) respectively. 
The input values [6..9] represents initial "Biomass concentration","total number of particle","Biofilm height","Biofilm surface roughness"
The input value [10] represents "Simulation time" (seconds)

(D) RUN the code:
The main source code is "emu.R". The emulator can be run from either the Window or Linux platform. 
Put the input file "input.txt" to be run in the subfolder "input". These files contain the parameter values and initial conditions.
To run any case, the input parameters must be converted to the units stated above to get correct results.

(i) To run from Window machine: At R console
> setwd(/path to/LAMMPS_emulator_V1b)
> source("emu.R",echo=TRUE)

(ii) To run from Linux terminal:
$ cd path to /LAMMPS_emulator_V1b
$ R CMD BATCH emu.R result.txt 

(E) Obtain the simulation results from subfolder "output".
The sample input.txt file in the "input" folder takes (~5minutes) to run the (2 days) simulation on Window 
and (~6 minutes) on Linux machines.

NOTE: This emulator will produce output for any specified time-steps and for any parameter combinations
