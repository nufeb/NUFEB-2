############LAMMPS EMULATOR version 1f####################
(A) DESCRIPTION
A coupled-emulator which produces rates of change of nutrient concentrations namely 
(nh3,no2,no3,o2,co2) and rates of change of the following characterized outputs
(Biomass concentration,number of particle, Biofilm height,Biofilm roughness) respectively.
For instance, dH/dt=(H_2-H_1)/(T_2-T_1)

(i) Rate of change of nh3 concentration
(ii) Rate of change of no2 concentration
(iii) Rate of change of no3 concentration
(iv) Rate of change of o2 concentration
(v) Rate of change of co2 concentration
(vi) Rate of change of biomass concentration (kg)
(vii) Rate of change of biofilm total number of particle (unitless)
(vii) Rate of change of biofilm average height (metre)
(ix) Rate of change of biofilm surface roughness (metre).

(B) All required data and R scripts for the emulator are in the directory "LAMMPS_emulator_V1f". 
The main c++ source code is "emu.cpp". 

(C) Input file description:
A sample "input.txt" file is placed in the "input" subfolder which is a required input parameters for running the emulator.
This contain 9 different values
The input values [1..5] represent "nh3","no2","no3","o2","co2" local nutrient substrates (mol/L) respectively. 
The input values [6..9] represent current values of "Biomass concentration","total number of particle","Biofilm height","Biofilm surface roughness"

(D) RUN the code:
The main source code is "emu.cpp". The emulator can be run from either the Window or Linux platform. 
Put the input file "input.txt" to be run in the subfolder "input". These files contain the parameter values and initial conditions.
To run any case, the input parameters must be converted to the units stated above to get correct results.

To run from Linux terminal:
$ cd path to /LAMMPS_emulator_V1f
/** compile .cpp file
$ g++ -O3 -I/usr/include/eigen3/ emu.cpp -o emu
/** run the code as
$ ./emu

(E) Obtain the simulation results from subfolder "output".

NOTE: This emulator will produce output for any specified time-steps and for any parameter combinations
