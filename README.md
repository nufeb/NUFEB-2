NUFEB is an open source tool for modelling and simulating microbial communities.
The tool is based on the Individual-based Modelling (IbM) approach, 
where microbes are represented as discrete units and their
behaviour changes over time due to a variety of processes. 

NUFEB is built on top of the molecular dynamics simulator
LAMMPS (as a LAMMPS' user package), extended with IbM features. 
A wide range of biological, physical and
chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems. 

NUFEB is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the terms
of the GNU Public License.

NUFEB development has been funded by the UKâ€™s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 
Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology (NUFEB) project.

### Getting source
Get NUFEB source code and submodules for its thirdparty libraries:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/nufeb/NUFEB --recursive
</pre>

### Building
NUFEB requires gcc/g++ and openmpi for a successful build.

Build NUFEB essential features without vtk or hdf5:
<pre>
./install.sh
</pre>
Build NUFEB with vtk:
<pre>
cd thirdparty
./install-vtk.sh
cd ..
./install.sh --enable-vtk
</pre>

### Running
Run a case in /examples after building NUFEB, for example:
<pre>
cd examples/biofilm-monod
mpirun -np 4 ../../lammps/src/./lmp_mpi -in Inputscript.lammps
</pre>
