	by the addition of typical aromatic compounds such as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene
	(TMB) and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPBz). 1,3,5-TIPBz was more
	useful than 1,3,5-TMB for obtaining spherical AOP particles with
	large mesopores (>20 nm) because 1,3,5-TIPBz with the boiling point
	(235 degrees C) much higher than the spray-drying temperature approximately
	110 degrees C) was accommodated in the surfactant assemblies effectively.
	The boiling point of 1,3,5-TMB (165 degrees C) was not so high that
	it cannot stay completely in the surfactant assemblies during the
	spray-drying process, and thus smoothness of the surfaces was also
	deteriorated by evaporation of 1,3,5-TMB. Accordingly, the use of
	1,3,5-TIPBz is effective for tuning uniform mesopores in the aerosol-assisted
	system of mesoporous AOP spherical particles with smooth surfaces.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the dust flux in the vicinity of Mercury
	due to interplanetary particles using Divine's five population model
	(J. Geophys. Res. 98(E9) (1993) 17029). The average accretion rate
	is 16 metric tonnes per day. The (mass weighted) mean impact speed
	is 26 kms1. Due to Mercury's non-negligible eccentricity, the accretion
	rate is found to vary by a factor of two along the orbit. However,
	detection rates of interplanetary particles on an impact ionisation
	detector mounted on a Mercury orbiting spacecraft can vary by more
	than a factor of ten while Mercury travels around the Sun. The variations
	in detection rates will reveal the dependence of the interplanetary
	dust cloud on heliocentric distance and ecliptic latitude (in the
	range covered by Mercury's orbit). An impact ionisation detector,
	which is sensitive to particles in the mass range m=1016109 g and
	has a target area of 100 cm2 would detect of order 10 particles per
	day. A momentum sensor, which is sensitive to particles m>1012 g
	would detect one particle every 23 days. We estimate that the number
	of impact light flashes which could be detected by the high-resolution
	camera on the Planetary Orbiter, planned within the ESA's BepiColombo
	mission, is between 0.4 and 660 light flashes during the entire mission.
	This result is dependent on the fraction of energy which is converted
	to light during an impact on the surface of Mercury. Since Mercury's
	thin exosphere cannot protect the planet from hypervelocity impacts
	of interplanetary meteoroids, Mercury will be surrounded by the ejecta
	created during these impacts. For the impact generated dust cloud
	we adopt the model described by Krivov and Hamilton (Icarus 128 (1997)
	335). Although the uncertainties of this model are large, we conclude
	that the ejecta should be detectable at least statistically, if the
	dust sensor is mounted on a spinning spacecraft which is in an elliptical
	orbit around Mercury.},

	organic contents were synthesized in one pot by reacting 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane
	(BTSE) with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) using a spray-drying technique.
	The scanning electron microscopy observation of spray-dried products
	clearly showed the formation of spherical particles. The 29Si magic
	angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance data revealed that the
	organic contents due to ethane fragments embedded in the frameworks
	were controllable and consistent with the BTSE/TEOS molar ratios
	of precursor solutions. Transmission electron microscopy, small-angle
	x-ray scattering, and N2 adsorption data of PMO with controlled organic
	contents indicated that the ethane fragments were embedded in the
	frameworks with the formation of ordered mesostructures. PMO with
	a high organic content (BTSE/TEOS=0.50) only showed a hydrophobic
	property. According to the same procedure, benzene groups were also
	integrated to a similar degree in the frameworks by using 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene.},
